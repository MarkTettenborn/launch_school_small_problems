# Write a method that takes a floating point number that represents 
# an angle between 0 and 360 degrees and returns a String that represents 
# that angle in degrees, minutes and seconds. You should use a degree 
# symbol (Â°) to represent degrees, a single quote (') to represent minutes, 
# and a double quote (") to represent seconds. A degree has 60 minutes, 
# while a minute has 60 seconds.
